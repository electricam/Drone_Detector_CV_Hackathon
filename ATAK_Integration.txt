🛰️ New Mission: Integrate RF Scanning → ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit)

Goal	Description
📡 Capture RF signals	(You're already doing this: frequency, power, timestamp)
🗺️ Geotag RF data	Add GPS coordinates (approximate if moving or fixed station)
🎯 Visualize RF Strengths	Push detections into ATAK as markers showing strength (circle size or color)
📍 Show movement	Over time, update RF points if they're moving (track drifting RF sources like drones)
🧠 What's Needed to Do This:

Task	How to Do It
🛜 Get a live GPS source	From your RPi (e.g., USB GPS dongle) or hardcode initial static position if indoors.
📤 Send RF detections to ATAK	Best done via Cursor-on-Target (CoT) XML over network (UDP broadcast, TCP push).
🖥️ Add a CoT server or broadcaster	Simple Python script listens for RF events and sends CoT packets.
🗂️ Format detections correctly	ATAK expects standard CoT fields: <event>, <point lat="" lon="" hae=""/>, etc.
📊 Encode RF Strength	Use circular radius size, or marker color to show signal power.
